Hey guys, welcome to my site. My name is Leona Guan and I am currently studying at University of Wisconsin-Madison. My main learning focus is ***Education***, including *Educational Psychology* and *Global Higher Education*. 

I believe that one can only be maximally benefited from education by being put in an educational environment that is constructed considering both *internal* (e.g., psychology) and *external* (e.g., educational policy) factors. And I am aiming to help construct such educational environment by studying *Education* from different perspectives.

- Understanding educational psychology to better help people who want to learn new things effectively
- Learning some Python basics since tech is becoming an indispensible part in everyone's life today
